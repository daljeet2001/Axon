# Axon - Workflow Automation Platform

Axon is a powerful, event-driven workflow automation platform that allows users to define **triggers** and **actions** across multiple services. It is designed for scalability and reliability using Kafka, Solana, PostgreSQL, and clean microservice architecture.

## üß† Architecture Overview

![Axon Architecture](./architecture.png)



### Components

- **Frontend**
  - User interface to create and manage workflows.
  - Lets users define triggers and multiple actions.
  - Sends workflow definitions to the backend.

- **Primary Backend**
 - Handles API requests from the frontend to create and manage workflows.
-  Generates unique webhook URLs for trigger-based workflows.

- **Hook Service**
  - Receives and persists workflow configurations.
  - Writes to `axonrun` and `axonrun_outbox` tables.
  - Triggers further processing.

- **Processor**
  - Monitors the database for outbox entries.
  - Publishes events to Kafka to signal workflow execution.

- **Kafka**
  - Decouples producers and consumers.
  - Handles message delivery and retries.
  - Ensures scalable and reliable workflow execution.

- **Worker**
  - Consumes Kafka events.
  - Executes side effects like sending emails or transferring SOL.

- **Database (PostgreSQL)**
  - Stores workflow definitions (`axonrun`) and outbox events (`axonrun_outbox`).
  - Ensures data consistency and auditability.

## üöÄ Features

- Event-driven architecture using Kafka.
- Outbox pattern for reliable message dispatch.
- External webhook and email support.
- SOL transfer functionality via Solana.
- Modular microservice design.
